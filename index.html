    <div>The food industry in the United States today are the major forces behind the disparities 
      in the production and distribution of foods. 
      Food companies operate in an economic environment that 
      demands continual growth of profits. 
      Without hesitation they strategically designed a marketing 
      scheme that hinders many low-income communities. 
      A place I can teach the community, particularly aiming for the youths, 
      how to create a garden for profit or for home consumption, study food injustice, 
      and promote environmental education is ideal in searching for a green space. </div>

    <div>This map displays public vacant land in Staten Island 
      as well as locations of farmers markets. 
      The goal is to build a new  garden in the vacant land to 
      increasing nutritious food while providing access to market. 
      When analyzing the final map, viewers can see that 1) 
      there are many vacant lots and very few establish garden, 
      2) only 3 farmers market which two happens to be in the same area, and 
      3) pop-ups provides interesting data such as season of operation and farmers market that accept EBT.
